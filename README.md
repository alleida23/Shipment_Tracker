# Shipment Tracker - Evolution

**Created by Albert Lleida, December 2023**

## Overview

The Shipment Tracker project, initiated in November 2023, has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Originally designed to address the manual tracking challenges associated with hundreds of shipments from TNT Express, the project has expanded its scope and capabilities.

## Project Background

The initial focus was on streamlining the labor-intensive process of manually tracking shipments from TNT. Employees had to navigate the TNT tracker page daily, searching for each shipment number to match client references with their company. This challenge sparked the creation of the TNT Shipment Tracker - Multiple Search.

## Current Scope

The project now boasts an expanded scope, incorporating DHL tracking through API integration. This enhancement ensures a more efficient and automated tracking process, providing a comprehensive solution for shipment tracking needs.

- **TNT Integration:** Web Scraping
- **DHL Integration:** API

## Future Prospects

The project's structure is designed to accommodate the integration of API details for additional transport companies. This flexibility positions the Shipment Tracker as a versatile solution ready to adapt to evolving tracking requirements.

Stay tuned for further updates as the Shipment Tracker continues to evolve and incorporate more features to meet diverse tracking needs.
